# TwitterClient

 - As a user I can login to Twitter;

 - As a user I see my twitter name in the actionbar;

 - As a user I can view my Twitter feed;

 - As a user I can refresh my feed using pull-to-refresh;

 - As a user I can view my Twitter feed without internet connection;

 - As a user I expect that feed will be automatically updated when network connection is available;

 - As a user I can tap on 'compose' FAB and get to post new tweet screen;

 - As a user I can post new tweet;

 - Every data-bound operation should have one of those states at UI:

    - empty state
  
    - in progress
  
    - failed
